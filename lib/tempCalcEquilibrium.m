function temperature_Out = tempCalcEquillibrium(tissue,bloodT,airT,nt,tmax,pastCalc,printprogress)
% tempCalcEquillibrium  Find the equillibrium values
%   tissue: holds all of the strucual information
%   bloodT: Temperature of the blood
%   airT:   Temperature of the surrounding ait
%   nt:     Max number of time steps
%   tmax:   Total amount of time the simulation should run over
%
%   This is based off of tempCalc() but loops until the rate of change of
%   a each voxel is sufficiently small then outputs what's
%   calculated.  If if takes too long to do all at once, split it up into
%   smaller time chunks and use the last step from the previous dataset as
%   pastCalc in order to resume.
%
%   Note: This does not save the time corse because it can take a lot of step to
%   find the equillibrium.  It outputs the last time step.

% ===========
%   This is a vectorized version of the next section.  For the love of god
%   don't make any changes to this without first looking below to make sure
%   you know what you're changing.  This is [nearly] impossible to
%   understand, so take your time and don't break it.
%   data is stored in 'tissue' as such :
%   [tissuetype 0 Qm c rho k w];  <--  second element is blank for all.
%   [    1      2  3 4  5  6 7

%  This makes an array that has smoothed out variations in k by averaging all
%  of the k's around each voxel (including itself).  This is a hap-hazard
%  solution to the problem that if you only take the value of k for the voxel
%  without considering what surrounds it, it doesn't matter whether the head
%  is surrounded by air, water or anything else.  Since water is a better
%  thermal conductor than air, we need a way of accounting for this.  This is
%  one way:
averagedk = (circshift(tissue(:,:,:,6),[1 0 0])+circshift(tissue(:,:,:,6),[-1 0 0])+circshift(tissue(:,:,:,6),[0 1 0])+circshift(tissue(:,:,:,6),[0 -1 0])+circshift(tissue(:,:,:,6),[0 0 1])+circshift(tissue(:,:,:,6),[0 0 -1])+tissue(:,:,:,6))/7;
